> To add a block, send a POST request to `/add` with the JSON block data in the request body. The block must satisfy the proof-of-work scheme described below.

## Proof of Work

Our AESHAM2 proof-of-work requires three nonces. For a block B to be added into the blockchain, it must be accepted by the following algorithm.

First, we compute a 256-bit AES key, seed, using the fist nonce, `B.nonces[0]`. It is going to be the SHA-256 hash of the concatenation of the following data:
* the bytes of parentid interpreted as a 32-byte number
* the bytes of root interpreted as a 32-byte number
* the 8 bytes of difficulty in big-endian order
* the 8 bytes of timestamp in big-endian order
* the 8 bytes of the first nonce in big-endian order
* the single version byte

In other words:

>     seed = SHA256(HexDecode(B.parentid) + HexDecode(B.root) + Bytes(B.difficulty) + Bytes(B.timestamp) + Bytes(B.nonces[0]) + B.version)

Second, we compute another 256-bit AES key, `seed2`, using the seed we just computed: `seed2 = SHA256(HexDecode(seed))`. Note that both seed and seed2 are interpreted as 32-byte numbers.

We then define `A(*) = AES(seed, *)` and `B(*) = AES(seed2, *)`. Let i, j be `B.nonces[1]` and `B.nonces[2]` in big-endian order repectively, and padded with leading 0's.

For a block B to be accepted into the blockchain, the following must be true:

* `B.parentid` is the SHA256 Hash of a header in the blockchain.
* `B.root` is the SHA256 hash of the block contents.
* `B.difficulty >= MinimumDifficulty = 86`.
* `B.timestamp` must be less than 2 minutes off from server.
* `i != j` and the hamming distance `Dist(A(i) + B(j) mod 2128, A(j) + B(i) mod 2128) <= 128 - B.difficulty`.

The target block interval is 10 minutes. Difficulty will be retargeted every 144 blocks: make sure you start early!

## Rules
* Do not seek outside help to mine blocks.
* You may use GPUs, FPGAs, ASICs, etc.
* Do not abuse MIT resources to mine blocks.
* Limit the number of requests you send to the server to 4 requests per minute.
